# Hospital Resource Demand Prediction and Allocation Optimization

## Overview

This project aims to predict hospital resource demand and optimize resource allocation using machine learning and optimization techniques. It leverages patient demographics, visit history, and hospital data to forecast resource needs and allocate them efficiently across different facilities.

## Project Structure

* **data:** Contains the raw and preprocessed data files.
* **resource_alloc_helium:** A Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, model building, and optimization.
* **src:** Holds the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and optimization algorithms.
* **requirements.txt:** Lists the project dependencies.
* **README.md:** This file.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for the list of necessary libraries. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** 
   - Place your data files in the `data` directory.
   - Update the data paths in the notebooks as needed.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Run the notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to train the prediction and optimization models.

3. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Execute the optimization algorithm in `src` to generate the allocation plan.

## Results

The project provides insights into:

* Factors influencing resource demand.
* Optimal allocation of resources across facilities.
* Potential resource bottlenecks and shortages.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open issues or pull requests.
